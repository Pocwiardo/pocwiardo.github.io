# BE in Automatic Control and Robotics | MSc CS Student | Software Developer

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Automatic Control, Cybernetics, and Robotics and am currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science. My interests are primarily in the fields of sound and image processing, machine learning, and physics. I also have a profound interest in music, both from a creative and technical perspective. I enjoy reading scientific articles on Music Information Retrieval and Generative AI in music, keen to expand my knowledge in these areas.

## Projects
### GGPT Music Composer

My biggest solo project and bachelor thesis work was developed using **Python**. It presents an **alternative approach to generating multitrack, full-length MIDI songs from text using ChatGPT API, genetic algorithms and probabilistic methods**. LLM defines structure, which includes time signature, scales, chord progressions, and valence-arousal values, from which accompaniment, melody,
bass, motif, and percussion tracks are created. The hybrid system uses emotional parameters from predicted point on valence-arousal plane, which have impact on GA fitness function and other parameters such as MIDI velocity range. Tracks and their sections are given their titles, and creative process is explained by ChatGPT in the chat window.

#### Example generations
To present the functionality of the system, I generated couple of songs using descriptions from Meta's MusicGen and Google's MusicLM sites,
